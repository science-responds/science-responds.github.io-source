## The Larger Scientific Community Responds to the COVID-19 Pandemic

The coronavirus continues to spread around the world and risks
overwhelming the health systems in many countries. We hope that you
are all well and are taking the necessary steps to protect yourselves,
your families and your colleagues.

The virus is having enormous direct health impacts on our society as well as
other major indirect social and economic impacts. The full scientific research
community and its rich set of tools are key to responding to these challenges.
This website has been set up by some "Big Science" (particle physics and
related fields) and computational science researchers to:

  1. Make connections to enable (non-medical) researchers to contribute to
     understanding and combating this global problem and/or its economic and
     societal impacts. How can researchers with significant data analytics,
     machine learning, simulation, software, computing, hardware development 
     and organizational
     skills contribute? Are there places where marshaling large "Big
     Science"-style distributed teams to tackle problems can be useful?

  2. Explore how all types of research activities can adapt and be effective in
     an era in which face-to-face meetings and travel are greatly reduced and
     conferences are being canceled. What are the lessons being learned and new
     ideas for how to approach this?

The website provides links to various information sources on COVID-19 related
research, resources and research projects. We are also actively engaged
through discussion in the Slack channel and periodic meetings in building
further connections and enabling related discussions.
