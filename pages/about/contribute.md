# Contribute

Please help us add content to the website! The source for the website is here:
[github.com\science-responds/science-responds.github.io-source](https://github.com/science-responds/science-responds.github.io-source). The README describes local previews and some of the basic site layout. We use Jekyll to build the site, and the Liquid template engine to build the data-powered pages, like projects and articles.

### Quick change

The smallest and simplest additions can be made through GitHub's edit interface. Just go to the page (probably in the `pages` folder) that you want to edit, and then click the pencil-like icon at the top right. Make your change, then save - GitHub will make a "fork" with your changes, and make a pull request with those changes. Even the most experienced of us sometimes to this to save time!

### Occasional changes

If you plan to make larger changes, manually make a fork (very top right in GitHub's UI), then make your changes there *preferably in a new branch* (makes updating later easier for you and checking your work out easier for maintainers). Then make a pull request to our repository.

The README has instructions for setting up a local development environment, so you can preview your changes live.

### Frequent contributor

If you plan to contribute more often, please ask us and we can probably add you to the master repository so that you can make branches without a fork.
