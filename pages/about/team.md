# Coordination Team

This is a volunteer organization patterned a bit after the [HEP Software Foundation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/), organized in a "bottoms-up" fashion.
We list some of the people working to coordinate activities, build connections
and engage additional people, but it is essentially a "do-acracy".

  * Peter Elmer, David Lange, Henry Schreiner, Savannah Thais - Princeton University
  * Mike Sokoloff - University of Cincinnati
  * Ian Fisk - Flatiron Institute
  * Markus Elsing, Maria Girone, Lukas Heinrich, [Mario Lassnig](https://twitter.com/mlassnig) - CERN
  * Chris Tunnell - Rice University
  * Mark Neubauer - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
