# Think Globally, Connect Locally

One idea we have is to reach out locally within our own universities
and local communities to see if there are local efforts we could help,
both directly and by connecting them to global efforts. It is also
bi-directional, we can benefit from anyone who is willing to help
inform this community, e.g. through short topical meetings/seminars
and/or discussions of what the research needs are for various COVID-19
activities. As always we
should be careful not to add noise to efforts that appear overloaded,
but find ways to be constructive, add value and start conversations. 

The initial reaction of most institutions was naturally the health and safety 
of personnel and students and then "continuity of critical operations". You 
may find that more of them are now trying to find ways to marshall
their capabilities and make an impact. Reaching
out to people within your local institution probably adds some "trust" 
value relative to strangers from another university or country. **We
are particularly interested in ways in which non-standard resources
are being deployed to support new and creative efforts in the face
of the pandemic and its effects.**
Here are some ideas for possible contacts you can make and questions you can 
explore within your own university or laboratory, and your local community: 

  * Does your research computing have a policy regarding COVID-19 activities?
    Are they supporting only local researchers? Do they have resources that
    they would like to make available to the larger research community?

  * Are there researchers on campus who are producing COVID-19-related data
    that they would like to make available in open-access repositories? Are
    there data handling issues related to local COVID-19 research? (Including
    the use of national resources by local teams?)

  * Are there any new and innovative COVID-19 research collaborations that 
    are forming between non-traditional partners on your campus?

  * Are there activities in your insitution towards temporary production of 
    medical equipment to help deal with the shortfalls in availability for
    health workers?
    For example, efforts to produce personal protective equipment using
    3D-printers, or ventilators and other associated items? 

If there are web links related to any of these things, please include them
in the summary below of the activities at your institution.
