# Computing resources

  A number of scientific computing and data resources are prioritizing 
and/or calling proposals on COVID-19 research. 

  * U.S. COVID-19 HPC Consortium - [website](https://covid19-hpc-consortium.org/)
    * XSEDE Resource Allocations System (XRAS) - [Preparing a COVID-19 HPC Consortium Request](https://www.xsede.org/covid19-hpc-consortium)

  * Open Science Grid - [website](https://opensciencegrid.org/)
    * Nominally part of XRAS above, but requests still being sorted out
    * Can help those who already share - or want to share - research computing capacity that their local institutions via OSG, and also to prioritize COVID-19 research
    * For both contact them directly for now: [help@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org)

  * WLCG
    * TBD

  * CERN
    * TBD

  * Zenodo - [website](https://zenodo.org/)
    * Zenodo is a general purpose open-access data repository. If you need to share data (COVID-19 or other) you can do this via Zenodo. [Sign-up](https://zenodo.org/signup/)
    * There are already many COVID-19 related datasets being served. Use the search function on the website to find things you need.
    

  * PRACE
    * [Fast Track Call for Proposals](https://prace-ri.eu/prace-support-to-mitigate-impact-of-covid-19-pandemic/)

  * Folding at Home - [website](https://foldingathome.org)
    * Volunteer computing for protein folding
    * See the links in the [project description](https://science-responds.org/projects/ds#fah) on this website

  * Rosetta@Home - [website](https://boinc.bakerlab.org)
    * Volunteer computing for protein folding, structure prediction and design

  * Compute4COVID - [GitHub](https://github.com/foertter/Compute4COVID)
    * A collection of compute resources for people doing research related to COVID virus curated by a small consortia of computing centers wishing to support efforts to combat COVID. It is intended to connect people to available resources.
    * Includes links to a collection of Cloud and HPC resources.
