# Ventilators

TODO: Add primer here.

## Jargon

  * [minute volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_minute_volume) - Respiratory minute volume (or minute ventilation or minute volume) is the volume of gas inhaled (inhaled minute volume) or exhaled (exhaled minute volume) from a person's lungs per minute. It is an important parameter in respiratory medicine due to its relationship with blood carbon dioxide levels

  * [Spirometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometer) - A spirometer is an apparatus for measuring the volume of air inspired and expired by the lungs. A spirometer measures ventilation, the movement of air into and out of the lungs.

  * [Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_end-expiratory_pressure) - Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is the pressure in the lungs (alveolar pressure) above atmospheric pressure (the pressure outside of the body) that exists at the end of expiration. (....) A small amount of applied (extrinsic) PEEP (4 to 5 cmH2O) is used in most mechanically ventilated patients to mitigate end-expiratory alveolar collapse.

  * CPAP

  * [Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_of_inspired_oxygen) - Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is the molar or volumetric fraction of oxygen in the inhaled gas.

  * [Tidal volume (symbol VT or TV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_volume) - The lung volume representing the normal volume of air displaced between[clarification needed] normal inhalation and exhalation when extra effort is not applied. In a healthy, young human adult, tidal volume is approximately 500 mL per inspiration (or 7 mL/kg of body mass).
