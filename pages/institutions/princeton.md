# Princeton University

  Princeton researchers are engaged in a [variety of COVID-19 related research projects](https://research.princeton.edu/research-administration/covid-19-information-researchers/covid-19-research-news). 
The University itself has recently funded a number of [rapid, novel and actionable COVID-19 research projects](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/04/10/princeton-awards-over-half-million-dollars-funding-rapid-novel-and-actionable-covid)

  Highlights include:

  * [Cristiano Galbiati](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/cristiano-galbiati), a professor of Physics, leads the [Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM)](http://mvm.care/) collaboration. The MVM project is working to produce an open and simple ventilator design which is both low cost and can be constructed and operated easily in various countries.
  * Princeton postdoc Savannah Thais has organized a session at the (now 
    virtual) April APS Meeting on the [Response of Physics to the 
    Coronavirus Pandemic](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR20/Session/Q08).
  * A number of Physics, Mechanical Engineering and Neuroscience researchers 
    have been
    working on the Princeton Open Vent Monitor, together with the regional
    hospital health care system in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. This is
    an open monitoring solution for use in field hospitals which might need
    to use older ventilator designs or assisted breathing devices that 
    lack modern patient monitoring capabilities.
