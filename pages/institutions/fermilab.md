# Fermi National Accelerator Lab (FNAL)

  Fermilab is a single purpose High Energy Physics lab limiting what we can officially do to fight COVID-19, however
 many of us are volunteering our time and talents, mobilizing our strengths in international partnerships and computing.
 Fermilab describes its COVID-19-related efforts on its [Fermilab in the fight against COVID-19](https://www.fnal.gov/pub/about/covid19/) webpage. 

  Highlights include:

  * Participation in the MVM ventilator project.
  * Fighting COVID with computing resources
  * Volunteering at the State Emergency Operations Center in Springfield
  
Please see the webpage for more details.
