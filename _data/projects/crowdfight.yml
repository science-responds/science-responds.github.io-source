title: Crowdfight COVID-19 

description: |
    This is an initiative from the scientific community to put all available
    resources at the service of the fight against COVID-19. It has separate
    portals for those already doing COVID-19 related research to request
    resources and for those not yet engaged to volunteer.  As of March 21, 2020
    this appears to be a (primarily) European initiative.
