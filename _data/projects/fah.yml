title: Folding at Home 

description: |
  Folding at Home uses computer simulations to understand the proteins that viruses use to 
  reproduce and suppress immune systems. This is done by taking the experimental structures 
  as starting points, we can simulate how all the atoms in the protein move. Doing so can 
  help health researchers find and understand new therapeutic opportunities. The 
  calculations involved in these simulations are enormous, and so volunteers can use their 
  existing compute resources to run folding simulations in the background and contribute 
  to the larger F@H database.
