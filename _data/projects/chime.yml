title: "CHIME: COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics" 

description: |
    As we prepare for the additional demands that the [COVID-19
    outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html) will place
    on our hospital system, our operational leaders need up-to-date projections
    of what additional resources will be required. Informed estimates of how
    many patients will need hospitalization, ICU beds, and mechanical
    ventilation over the coming days and weeks will be crucial inputs to
    readiness responses and mitigation strategies.To this end, the [Predictive
    Healthcare](http://predictivehealthcare.pennmedicine.org/) team at Penn
    Medicine has developed a tool that leverages [SIR
    modeling](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SIRModel.html) to assist hospitals
    with capacity planning around COVID-19.
    [CHIME](https://github.com/pennsignals/chime) allows hospitals to enter
    information about their population and modify assumptions around the spread
    and behavior of COVID-19. It then runs a standard SIR model to project the
    number of new hospital admissions each day, along with the daily hospital
    census. These projections can then be used to create best- and worst-case
    scenarios to assist with capacity planning. It is currently being used by a
    few hospitals and theyâ€™re looking to expand!

needs: |
    Primarily Devops folks to help scale up the models/app and automate data collection and Project Managers to help develop documentation and ensure user accessibility. Possibly some modeling folks as well.
