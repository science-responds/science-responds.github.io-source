title: "COVID Care Map"

description: |
  This project aims to understand, anticipate, and act to support and ramp up our health systems' capacity (beds, staffing, ventilators, supplies) to effectively care for a rapidly growing number of active COVID19 patients in need of hospitalization and intensive (ICU) care. We do open-source data collection, geospatial analysis, visualizations, and scenario-planning tools aimed at informing resource planning and deployment decisionmaking to support our healthcare providers at local, county, & state scale when and where the needs are greatest. USA-centric at the moment but tools and knowhow are intended to be applicable globally.
