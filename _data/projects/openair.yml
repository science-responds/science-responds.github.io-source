title: Project Open Air (Just One Giant Lab)

description: |
    Project Open Air/Helpful Engineers, hosted within the broader open science
    group Just One Giant Lab has created a 5,000 strong volunteer organization,
    with engineers, scientists and doctors around the world who work to
    organize themselves into teams to design innovative ways to fight the
    virus. They are quickly trying to design and arrange the production of
    pragmatic devices to move life-saving air, extend existing tools, or
    organize volunteers on the ground to bolster medical workers. They have
    both hardware and software based projects including designing open source,
    scalable easy to DIY ventilators and O2 concentrators, sentiment analysis
    for persuasive public health media, diagnostic apps, and more!
