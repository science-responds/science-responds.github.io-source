title: CORD19 Dataset

description: |
    This open dataset is supported by the White House Office of Science and
    Technology Policy, The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Microsoft Research, The
    Allen Institute for AI, The NIH Library of Medicine, Georgetown’s Center
    for Security and Emerging Technology, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, and Kaggle
    AI. CORD-19 is a resource of over 29,000 scholarly articles, including over
    13,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related
    coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global
    research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing
    and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing
    fight against this infectious disease. The dataset represents the most
    extensive machine-readable coronavirus literature collection available for
    data and text mining to date and is updated as new research is published in
    peer-reviewed publications and archival services.
