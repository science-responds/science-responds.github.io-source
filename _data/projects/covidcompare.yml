title: COVID Compare

description: |
    This project is just kicking off and is working on tracking/mapping the
    relative risk of Covid19 in the US. 50 cases in Kentucky is not the same as
    50 cases in NYC. People arenâ€™t good at normalizing out other variables like
    population/hospital access so I want to do that for them visually.

  - "[Project GitHub](https://github.com/rbracco/covidcompare)"


needs: |
    Data scientists, model builders, public health folks to help build a
    quantifier for risk and a predictive tool, web app developers and data
    visualizers, data collectors.
