title: COVID-19 Risk

description: |
    This project is focusing on research that could lead to an app that shows
    individuals their risk of COVID-19 infection based off GPS data, known cases,
    and Bluetooth proximity networks. They aim to do so in a way that preserves
    transparency and personal privacy. This is a  group of volunteers researching
    and designing an open-source app to make this idea a reality. Ideally, this app
    will take the GPS and Bluetooth data of users in an anonymised way, as well as
    some information about their potential or confirmed infection status, and use
    it to the benefit of both them and everybody else. There are several ways this
    could happen: through secure and anonymous [contact
    tracing](http://covid19risk.com/CSCT.pdf), through the creation of a risk
    [heatmap](http://covid19risk.com/heatmap), and through more accurate
    epidemiological modelling.
