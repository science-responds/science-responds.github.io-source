title: Johns Hopkins Mapping nCOV Project

description: |
    This team has developed an [interactive web-based
    dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)
    hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns
    Hopkins University, to visualize and track reported cases in real-time. The
    dashboard illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases,
    deaths and recoveries for all affected countries. It was developed to
    provide researchers, public health authorities and the general public with
    a user-friendly tool to track the outbreak as it unfolds. Additionally, the
    data (which is verified and updated daily) is available on GitHub. They are
    interested in conducting additional modeling of the emerging outbreak.

    It doesnâ€™t explicitly say on the website, but presumably ML researchers, model-builders, data visualization folks, data scientists.
